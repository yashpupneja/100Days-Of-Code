    "Q.) Is there a difference in heights of students in cl1 and cl2 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.)1. Choosing a test statistic:If mean height of cl2-mean height of cl1 is 0 then there is no difference in height of students in class1 and class2.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis : Opposite of null hypothesis e.g. there is difference in between two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. p-value(computational part): What is the probability of the observation? e.g what is the probability of observing the difference of means if null hypothesis is true. If we assume null hypothesis is true and we do not know for now how to calculate the p-value and hence p-value is given as 0.9 .This p-value means that the probability of difference is 0.9 even if the difference in the means of two classes is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p-value=0.05 ==> only 5% chance that 10cm if null hypothesis is true.Hence accept alternate hypothesis ."
